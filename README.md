Swift - Swipe Gesture Demo

App created in Xcode 10.3 (10G8) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.4 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

This is a swipe gesture demo app you could use on your iOS device. All a user has to do is click on the 'Swipe Gesture Demo'
icon and they are taken right into the app. On the top is a label with the title 'Swipe Gesture Demo'. Then right below is
an imageview that displays a graphic for which direction the user made a swipe in. Then right below is a yellow background 
large label with the text 'Swipe Away'. 

As the user makes a swipe in the yellow area the graphic image shows which direction they swiped in and the text in the 
swipe box also spells it out. Its an interesting simple app which shows how we can use swipe gestures to change an image
displayed and text in a label
